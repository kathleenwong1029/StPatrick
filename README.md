L#01 -- What Does the Data Say?

Kathleen Wong, Susan Lin, Puneet Johal

## Hypothesis ##
As the size of the array, n, increases, the runtime will also increase at a ** rate**. 

## Background ##
QuickSort.java should have a runtime of **O()**.

type in javac QuickSortTester.java

then type in java QuickSortDriver > data.csv

## Best Case ##
The best case scenario of the following QuickSort algorithm is . 

## Average or Most Likely Case ##
The most likely/average case scenario of the following QuickSort algorithm is .

## Worst Case ## 
The worst case scenario of the following QuickSort algorithm is .

## Methodology ##

## Results ##
![](./graph.png)

The data shows that the runtime is roughly .

We were able to formulate a line of best fit, ****.  

## Conclusions ##
The function runs in time with negligble deviations.


The data indicates that . 

## Conclusions ##
The sort algorithm runs in .

The minor deviations were mostly likely caused by the randomness of the target number which could have led to either a worst or best case scenario.
